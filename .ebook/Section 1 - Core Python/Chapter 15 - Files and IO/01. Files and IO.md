# Files and I/O

## Files

Python provides many modules to handle files, depending upon it's property. We are going to cover few of them in this section. 



```python
# The old way .... the C, C++ etc way
import sys

# Create an object of type file
# 'r' -> Read Mode
# 'w' -> Write Mode
# 'a' -> Append Mode

temp = open('temp.txt', 'w')

# Write output
for i in range(7):
    temp.write('%03d\n' % i)

temp.close()

# default mode is read only. 
temp = open('temp.txt')
# temp1 opening in write mode 
temp1 = open('temp1.txt', "w")

# Write in terminal
for x in temp:
    print("x = {x}".format(x=x), end="")
    temp1.write(x)

temp.close()
temp1.close()
```

    x = 000
    x = 001
    x = 002
    x = 003
    x = 004
    x = 005
    x = 006



```python
# New Way, The Python way
# Using context manager `with`

# Create an object of type file
# equivalent: temp = open(...)
with open('temp.txt', 'w') as temp:
    # Write output
    for i in range(5):
        temp.write('%03d\n' % i)

with open('temp.txt') as temp:
    # lets read the file
    for x in temp:
        x = x.strip()   # Stripping the newline at the end of the string
        print(x, end=", ")  # Write in terminal
print("\b\b")
```

    000, 001, 002, 003, 004, 



```python
# replace content of the file without temp file. 
# on the fly content changes
# NEVER EVER DO THIS
txt = []
temp = open('temp.txt', 'r')
for t in temp.readlines():
#     print("d")
    txt.append(t.replace('0','11'))

temp.close()
with open('temp.txt', 'w') as tfile:
    tfile.writelines(txt)
```


```python
# copying content from temp.txt to temp2.txt,
# Bad for large files 

with open('temp.txt', 'r') as temp:
    with open('temp2.txt', 'w') as tfile:
        tfile.writelines(temp.readlines())
```


```python
# copying content from temp.txt to temp2.txt,
# Dont try on big files

with open('temp.txt') as temp:
    with open('temp3.txt', 'w') as tfile:
        for content in temp.readlines():
            print(content, end="")
            tfile.write(content)
```

    111111
    11111
    11112
    11113
    11114


We can club both the context managers `with` as shown in the below example


```python
# copying content from temp.txt to temp2.txt
# Dont try on big files 

with open('temp.txt') as temp, \
     open('temp4.txt', 'w')  as tfile:
    for content in temp.readlines():
        print(content, end="")
        tfile.write(content)
```

    111111
    11111
    11112
    11113
    11114


If we have to copy only few top lines from file, than something similar to below example can be used. In it we are using optional parameter `size` to tell how much data needs to be copied. 

> Note
> <hr>
> If `size` is provided, then it will be increased to accomodate full line as shown in below example.


```python
with open('temp.txt') as temp, open('temp4.txt', 'w')  as tfile:
    for content in temp.readlines(8):
        print(content, end="")
        tfile.write(content)
```

    111111
    11111


We have returned 12 charactes instead of 10,


```python
for s in range(8, 13):
    print("~" * 20, "size is:", s)
    with open('temp.txt') as temp, \
         open('temp4.txt', 'w')  as tfile:
        for content in temp.readlines(s):
            print(content, end="")
            tfile.write(content)
```

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ size is: 8
    111111
    11111
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ size is: 9
    111111
    11111
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ size is: 10
    111111
    11111
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ size is: 11
    111111
    11111
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ size is: 12
    111111
    11111


We should not use `readlines` when processing large files, but code similar to below.


```python
import os 
os.remove('temp4.txt')
with open('temp.txt') as temp, open('temp4.txt', 'w')  as tfile:
    for content in temp:
        print(content, end="")
        tfile.writelines(content)
```

    111111
    11111
    11112
    11113
    11114



```python
# Prints a list with all the lines from a file
print (open('temp4.txt').readlines())
```

    ['111111\n', '11111\n', '11112\n', '11113\n', '11114\n']



```python
import sys
import os.path

fn = 'temp.txt'

if os.path.exists(fn):
    # Numbering lines
    for i, s in enumerate(open(fn), start=1):
        print (i, s, end="")
else:
    print("Sorry, I was not able to locate the file.")
```

    1 111111
    2 11111
    3 11112
    4 11113
    5 11114


It is possible to read all the lines with the method `readlines()`:


```python
print(len(open('temp.txt').readlines())) # 20
print(len(open('temp.txt').read())) # 4x20
```

File Systems
-------------------
Modern operating systems store files in hierarchical structures called *file systems*.

Several features related to file systems are implemented in the module *os.path*, such as: 

+ `os.path.basename()`: returns the final component of a path.
+ `os.path.dirname()`: returns a path without the final component.
+ `os.path.exists()`: returns *True* if the path exists or *False* otherwise.
+ `os.path.getsize()`: returns the size of the file in *bytes*.
- `os.path.join()`: joins the files, directory

*glob* is another module related to the file system:


```python
# Bad code example

import os.path 

a = r"/home/mayank/apps/appvhelper"
b = r"conf/myprogram.conf"
c = os.path.join(a, b)
print(c)
```

    /home/mayank/apps/appvhelper/conf/myprogram.conf



```python
# Better code.
db_file = os.path.join("appfolder", "config","database","db.sqlite")
print(db_file)
```

    appfolder/config/database/db.sqlite


Based on the OS the "\\" or "/" is used to join the directories.


```python
# Gotcha's
import os.path 

conf_files = [r"/home/mayank/apps/ls/warzone/myprogram.conf",
              r"C:\Users\God\mayaappvhelper\conf\user.conf"
             ]

for conf in conf_files:
    print(os.path.split(conf))
```

    ('/home/mayank/apps/ls/warzone', 'myprogram.conf')
    ('', 'C:\\Users\\God\\mayaappvhelper\\conf\\user.conf')


Since the above code was exected on "Linux", thus the second conf_file was not properly split. we might use `ntpath` instead as shown below to forcefully use windows specific changes. 


```python
import ntpath

cp = r"C:\Users\God\mayaappvhelper\conf\user.conf"
print(ntpath.split(cp))
```

    ('C:\\Users\\God\\mayaappvhelper\\conf', 'user.conf')



```python
db_file = ntpath.join("appfolder", "config","database","db.sqlite")
print(db_file)
```

    appfolder\config\database\db.sqlite



```python
# A better approch
import os.path 

conf_files = [
    ("home", "mayank", "app", "myprogram.conf"),
    ("C:", "Users", "God", "user.conf")
]

for conf in conf_files:
    print(os.path.join(*conf))
```

    home/mayank/app/myprogram.conf
    C:/Users/God/user.conf



```python
conf_file = "appfolder\config\database\db.sqlite"
print(os.path.split(os.path.split(conf_file)[0]))
```

    ('', '')



```python
print(os.path.split(conf_file)[1])
```

    appfolder\config\database\db.sqlite



```python
print(os.path.splitext(conf_file))
```

    ('appfolder\\config\\database\\db', '.sqlite')



```python
print(os.path.splitext(conf_file)[0] + ".json")
```

    appfolder\config\database\db.json


Please, dont use splitext to find the file ext, you can use the following code.


```python
print(os.path.splitext(conf_file)[1].endswith(".conf"))
```

    False



```python
print(os.path.splitext(conf_file)[1].endswith(".json"))
```

    False



```python
conf_file_win = "C:\\apps\MLCA\test.txt"
print(os.path.splitdrive(conf_file_win))
```

    ('', 'C:\\apps\\MLCA\test.txt')


> **NOTE**:
> 
> splitdrive, is good for windows based os only as other OSes dont have drivers. 


```python
conf_file = "C:\\windows\system32\reg.exe"
print(ntpath.splitdrive(conf_file))
```

    ('C:', '\\windows\\system32\reg.exe')



```python
import os.path
import glob

# Shows a list of file names
# and their respective sizes 
for arq in sorted(glob.glob('*.*')):
    print (arq, os.path.getsize(arq))
```

    temp4.txt 31


The *glob.glob()* function returns a list of filenames that meet the criteria passed as a parameter in a similar way to the `ls` command available on UNIX systems.

Temporary files
--------------------
The module *os* implements some functions to facilitate the creation of temporary files, freeing the developer from some concerns, such as:

+ Avoiding collisions with names of files that are in use.
+ Identifying the appropriate area of the file system for temporary files (which varies by operating system).
+ Not exposing the implementation risks (temporary area is used by other processes).

Example:


```python
import tempfile

# create a temporary file and write some data to it
fp = tempfile.TemporaryFile()
fp.write(b'Hello world!')
# read data from file
fp.seek(0)
fp.read()
```




    b'Hello world!'




```python
print(fp.name)
```

    59



```python
# close the file, it will be removed
fp.close()
```


```python
# create a temporary file using a context manager
with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as fp:
    fp.write(b'Hello world!')
    fp.seek(0)
    print(fp.read())

# file is now closed and removed
```

    b'Hello world!'



```python
# create a temporary directory using the context manager
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdirname:
    print('created temporary directory', tmpdirname)
    file_name = os.path.join(tmpdirname, "myfile.txt")
    print(file_name)
    with open(file_name, "w") as fp:
        fp.write("Hello world")
    from time import sleep
    sleep(20)
    print("timeout, delete the temp folder along with files")
    
# directory and contents have been removed
```

    created temporary directory /var/folders/y9/t24gny492mb10bht0gvvqyjm0000gp/T/tmpm7bf6fbw
    /var/folders/y9/t24gny492mb10bht0gvvqyjm0000gp/T/tmpm7bf6fbw/myfile.txt
    timeout, delete the temp folder along with files



```python
from time import sleep
    
try:
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdirname:
        print('created temporary directory', tmpdirname)
        file_name = os.path.join(tmpdirname, "myfile.txt")
        print(file_name)
        with open(file_name, "w") as fp:
            fp.write("Hello world")
        sleep(20)
        raise Exception
        print("This should never ever get executed.")
        sleep(20)
        print("timeout ")
except Exception as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

    created temporary directory /var/folders/y9/t24gny492mb10bht0gvvqyjm0000gp/T/tmpqu8go0dg
    /var/folders/y9/t24gny492mb10bht0gvvqyjm0000gp/T/tmpqu8go0dg/myfile.txt
    Error: 


The objects of type file also have the method `seek()`, which allow going to any position in the file.

There is also the `tempnam()` function, which returns a valid name for temporary file, including a path that respects the conventions of the operating system. However, it is up to the developer to ensure that the routine is used so as not to compromise the security of the application.

Compressed files
--------------------
Python has modules to work with multiple formats of compressed files.

Example of writing a ".zip" file:


```python
"""
Writing text in a compressed file
"""

import zipfile

text = """
**************************************
This text will be compressed and ...
... stored inside a zip file.
***************************************
"""

# Creates a new zip
zip = zipfile.ZipFile('new_zip.zip', 'w',
    zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)

# Writes a string in zip as if it were a file
zip.writestr('text.txt', text)
zip.writestr('text1.txt', text)
zip.writestr('text2.txt', text)
# closes the zip
zip.close()
```


```python
"""
Writing text in a compressed file
"""

import zipfile

text = """
**************************************
This text will be compressed and ...
... stored inside a zip file using 
... Context Manager on Zipfile module .
***************************************
"""

# Writes a string in zip as if it were a file
with zipfile.ZipFile('new_zip.zip', 'w', 
                     zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipfile:
    zipfile.writestr('text11.txt', text)
    zipfile.writestr('text12.txt', text)
    zipfile.writestr('text23.txt', text)
```

**Reading example:**


```python
"""
Reading a compressed file
"""
import zipfile

# Open the zip file for reading 
with zipfile.ZipFile('new_zip.zip') as zip:
    # Gets a list of compressed files
    file_list = zip.namelist()
    print("Files: ", file_list)
    for arq in file_list:
        # Shows the file name
        print('File:', arq)
        # get file info
        zipinfo = zip.getinfo(arq)
        print('Original size:', zipinfo.file_size)
        print('Compressed size:', zipinfo.compress_size)
    #     print(dir(zipinfo))

        # Shows file content
        print(zip.read(arq))
```

    Files:  ['text11.txt', 'text12.txt', 'text23.txt']
    File: text11.txt
    Original size: 193
    Compressed size: 105
    b'\n**************************************\nThis text will be compressed and ...\n... stored inside a zip file using \n... Context Manager on Zipfile module .\n***************************************\n'
    File: text12.txt
    Original size: 193
    Compressed size: 105
    b'\n**************************************\nThis text will be compressed and ...\n... stored inside a zip file using \n... Context Manager on Zipfile module .\n***************************************\n'
    File: text23.txt
    Original size: 193
    Compressed size: 105
    b'\n**************************************\nThis text will be compressed and ...\n... stored inside a zip file using \n... Context Manager on Zipfile module .\n***************************************\n'


Python also provides modules for gzip, bzip2 and tar formats that are widely used in UNIX environments.

Data file
----------------
In the standard library, Python also provides a module to simplify the processing of files in CSV (*Comma Separated Values*) format.

In CSV format, the data is stored in text form, separated by commas, one record per line.

Writing example:


```python
import csv

with open('eggs.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=',',
                            quotechar='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
    csv_writer.writerow(['Spam'] * 5 + ['Baked Beans'])
    csv_writer.writerow(['Spam', None ,'Lovely "Spam"', 'Wonderful, Spam'])
```


```python
import csv

with open('eggs.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    csv_writer.writerow(['Spam'] * 5 + ['Baked Beans'])
    csv_writer.writerow(['Spam', None ,'Lovely "Spam"', 'Wonderful, Spam'])
```


```python
lst = [["a", "a1"], ["b", "b1"], ["d", "d1 ,one"], "c", "f" ]
with open('list.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    listWriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    for l in lst:
        listWriter.writerow(l)
```

Reading example:


```python
import csv

with open("list.csv", newline='') as csvfile:
    for row in csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ', quotechar='|'):
        print(', '.join(row))
```

    a,a1
    b,b1
    d,"d1, ,one"
    c
    f


The CSV format is supported by most spreadsheet and databases for data import and export.

## IO

In Python:

+ *sys.stdin* is the standard input.
+ *sys.stdout* is the standard output.
+ *sys.stderr* is the standard error output.

The standard `input`, `output` and `error` are handled by Python as `open` files. 

Example of using std*'s:

### `sys.stdout`

#### `sys.stdout.write`


```python
from sys import stdout

stdout.write("Hello World")
stdout.write("Hello World")
stdout.write("Hello World")
```

    Hello WorldHello WorldHello World
