## <span style="color:Green">copy</span>: Shallow and deep copy operations

-----
In most of the programming languages assignment statement `=` equates to copy and thus are never in need of any other operator for creating a copy of an existing object. 

Lets start with exploring the assignment statement in python.

### Assignment ( = )

-----

**Assignments in Python do not copy objects, instead they create bindings between a target and the object**.


```python
x = 10
y = x
print(id(x), id(y))
```

    1722792688 1722792688



```python
x = [10, 3]
y = x
print(x , y)
x[1] = "This is a test message"
print(x, y)
```

    [10, 3] [10, 3]
    [10, 'This is a test message'] [10, 'This is a test message']



```python
x = 10
print(id(x))
x +=1
y = x 
print(id(x), id(y))
```

    1722792688
    1722792720 1722792720



```python
x = 10
print(id(x))
y = x 
x = "d"
print(id(x), id(y))
print(y, x)
```

    1722792688
    2216063056280 1722792688
    10 d



```python
x = "10"
y = x + "1"
print(id(x), id(y))
print(x , y)
```

    2216073178616 2216103588952
    10 101



```python
x = 10
y = x
print(id(x), id(y))
x = 111
print(id(x), id(y))
```

    1719909104 1719909104
    1719912336 1719909104



```python
x = [10, 20, 30]
y = x
print(id(x), id(y))
x[2] = 100
print(x, y)
```

    2160435348616 2160435348616
    [10, 20, 100] [10, 20, 100]


In the above example, x and y variables are pointing to same memory location and are two names to the same memory object, thus change in one will result in updating another value as long as they are not assigned to another memory location.
With that in mind lets explore the new example


```python
x = [10, 20, 30]
y = x
print(id(x), id(y))
x = 100
print(x, y)
print(id(x), id(y))
```

    2793410766024 2793410766024
    100 [10, 20, 30]
    1722795568 2793410766024



```python
x = ['a','b','c','d']
lst = [x, x]
print(x, lst)
x[2] = 'dd'
print(x, lst)
```

    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] [['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']]
    ['a', 'b', 'dd', 'd'] [['a', 'b', 'dd', 'd'], ['a', 'b', 'dd', 'd']]


#### Copy with the Slice Operator

Copying using slice can help us upto a certain level as shown in the below example


```python
# immutable values based list

x = ['a b','b c','c','d']
y = x[:2]
```


```python
print(x, y)
# Good :)
print(id(x), id(y))
```

    ['a b', 'b c', 'c', 'd'] ['a b', 'b c']
    4379850064 4379849984



```python
# but :(
print(id(x[1]), id(y[1]))
# as they are immutable, the value of only one will get updated. 
x[1] = "33"
print(x, y)
```

    4380632432 4380660400
    ['a b', '33', 'c', 'd'] ['a b', 'b c']



```python
# Good :)
print(id(x), id(y))
# but :(
print(id(x[1]), id(y[1]))
```

    4379850064 4379849984
    4380632432 4380660400


but may will fail, if we have mutable data-types with in the list as shown in below examples


```python
x = [["a1", "b1", "c1"],'a','b','c','d']
y = x[:]
print(x, y)
# Good :)
print(id(x), id(y))
```

    [['a1', 'b1', 'c1'], 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] [['a1', 'b1', 'c1'], 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    4380497312 4380596416



```python
# but :(
print(id(x[0]), id(y[0]))
# thus 
```

    4380627264 4380627264



```python
x[0][1] = "33"
# oops
print(x, y)
# Good :)
print(id(x), id(y))
# but :(
print(id(x[1]), id(y[1]))
```

    [['a1', '33', 'c1'], 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] [['a1', '33', 'c1'], 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    4380497312 4380596416
    4346038896 4346038896


Since `['a1', '33', 'c1']` is same on both the lists, changing elements in one list will also get updated in the second list as they are pointing to the same list

Now we now know that in Python **Assignment statements do not _copy objects_, instead they create bindings between a target and an object** and can't be used to create a copy of the existing object. 

Few More Examples for better understanding


```python
magic_list = [1,2,3]
print (magic_list)

    i = i+1

For collections which are mutable or contain mutable items, copy is sometimes needed so one can change one copy without changing the other. 
Fortunately we have This module provides generic shallow and deep copy operations called **`copy`**. 
It provides two functions, one for **shallow copy** and another for **deep copy**. 

### Shallow Copy - copy.copy(x)

**`Shallow copy` duplicates minimal possible**

`Shallow copy` of a collection is a copy of the collection structure, but not the elements. After shallow copy, both original and copied collection, share the individual elements.

Lets examine the below example for details


```python
import copy

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name): # contructor
        self.name = name
        
    def __cmp__(self, other):
        return cmp(self.name, other.name)
```


```python
a = MyClass('a')
l = [a, 10]
dup = copy.copy(l)
```


```python
print ('l  :', l)
print ('dup:', dup)
```

    l  : [<__main__.MyClass object at 0x1051c4610>, 10]
    dup: [<__main__.MyClass object at 0x1051c4610>, 10]



```python
print ('dup is l:', (dup is l))
print ('dup == l:', (dup == l))
print ('dup[0] is l[0]:', (dup[0] is l[0]))
print ('dup[0] == l[0]:', (dup[0] == l[0]))
```

    dup is l: False
    dup == l: True
    dup[0] is l[0]: True
    dup[0] == l[0]: True



```python
x = [["a"], ["b"], ["c"]]
dup_x = copy.copy(x)
print(id(x), id(dup_x))
```

    4380746608 4380712784



```python
print(id(x[0]), id(dup_x[0]))
```

    4379861312 4379861312



```python
print(id(x[0][0]), id(dup_x[0][0]))
```

    4346038896 4346038896



```python
x[0].append("xyz")
```


```python
print(id(x[0][0]), id(dup_x[0][0]))
```

    4346038896 4346038896



```python
print(x, dup_x)
```

    [['a', 'xyz'], ['b'], ['c']] [['a', 'xyz'], ['b'], ['c']]



```python
x.append("x")
```


```python
print(x, dup_x)
```

    [['a', 'xyz'], ['b'], ['c'], 'x'] [['a', 'xyz'], ['b'], ['c']]



```python
print(id(x[3]), id(x[4]))
print(x[3], x[4])
```

    x x


## Deep Copy - `copy.deepcopy(x)`

Return a deep copy of x. Use when we have mutable elements.


```python
x = [[["a b"], 10292], ["b c"], ["c d"]]
dup_x = copy.deepcopy(x)
print(id(x), id(dup_x))
```

    4380712784 4380746688



```python
print(id(x[0]), id(dup_x[0]))
```

    4380657456 4380697056



```python
# Only mutable objects are copied.
print(id(x[0][0]), id(dup_x[0][0]))
print(x[0][0], dup_x[0][0])
```

    4380496672 4380496272
    ['a b'] ['a b']



```python
# and immutable objects are same. As only mutable object will
# have any side effects.
print(id(x[0][0][0]), id(dup_x[0][0][0]))
print(x[0][0][0], dup_x[0][0][0])
```

print ('dup[0] is l[0]:', (dup[0] is l[0]))
print ('dup[0] == l[0]:', (dup[0] == l[0]))
```

### Difference between shallow and deep copying

The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or class instances):

    A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.
    A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.

Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that don't exist with shallow copy operations:

    Recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly, contain a reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop.
    Because deep copy copies everything it may copy too much, such as data which is intended to be shared between copies.

The deepcopy() function avoids these problems by:

    keeping a 'memo' dictionary of objects already copied during the current copying pass; and
    letting user-defined classes override the copying operation or the set of components copied.

### Controlling Copy Behavior

It is possible to control how copies are made using the __copy__ and __deepcopy__ hooks.

    __copy__() is called without any arguments and should return a shallow copy of the object.
    __deepcopy__() is called with a memo dictionary, and should return a deep copy of the object. Any member attributes that need to be deep-copied should be passed to copy.deepcopy(), along with the memo dictionary, to control for recursion (see below).

This example illustrates how the methods are called:


```python
import copy

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def __cmp__(self, other):
        return cmp(self.name, other.name)
    
    def __copy__(self):
        print ('__copy__()')
        return MyClass(self.name)
    
    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
        print ('__deepcopy__(%s)' % str(memo))
        return MyClass(copy.deepcopy(self.name, memo))

a = MyClass('a')

sc = copy.copy(a)
dc = copy.deepcopy(a)
```

    __copy__()
    __deepcopy__({})



```python
# quick and dirty way to find mutable object
x = [10, 2]
print(isinstance(x, (list, tuple, dict)))
print('__iter__' in dir(x))  
# this should work in all except tuple, but tuple can also 
# contain mutable data, so its ok.
```

    True
    True



```python
# quick and dirty way to find mutable object
x = "[10, 2]"
print(isinstance(x, (list, tuple, dict)))
print('__iter__' in dir(x))  
# this should work in all except tuple & string, but tuple can also 
# contain mutable data, so its ok.
```

    False
    True
