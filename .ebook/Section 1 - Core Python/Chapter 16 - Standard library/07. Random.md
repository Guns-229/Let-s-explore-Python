## Random

The *random* module brings functions for random number generation.

Examples:

### Choice


```python
import string

from random import choice

# Choice returns one value from the list
print(choice(string.ascii_uppercase))
print(choice([10, 200, 399, "Hello", "God", "Python", [222]]))
```


```python
d = {"manoj": "kumar", 
    "GV": "ibm",
    "Roshan": "Musheer",
    "Pavan": "Hota"}
print(choice(list(d.keys())))
```

### `random.random`

it returns a random float between 0 to 1


```python
from random import random
# Choose a float from 0 to 1
for _ in range(3): print(random())
```


```python
a = random()
x = a*100
print (a, x, int(x))
```

### `random.randrange`


```python
from random import randrange
# Choose a number from 1 to 10
for x in range(10):
    x = randrange(0, 100)
    print (x, end="   ")
```


```python
import random
lst = ["a", "b", "c", "e"]
dirs ={}

for  l in lst:
    dirs[l] = random.randrange(1, 100)

print(dirs)
```

### `choices`: A weighted version of random
> Python >= 3.6


```python
from random import choices

lnct_few_friends = ["Jyoti Pancholi", 
                    "Amit Shrivastava", 
                    "Mukesh Bansal", 
                    "Preeti Saraswat", 
                    "Manish Nandle"]
list_of_prob = [0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2]
prob = choices(lnct_few_friends, 
               weights=list_of_prob, 
               k=10)

print(prob)
print("~^"*10)
for name in lnct_few_friends:
    print(name, prob.count(name))
```

Lets try some graphs on them


```python
from random import choices


lnct_few_friends = ["X", "Jyoti Pancholi", 
                    "Amit Shrivastava", 
                    "Mukesh Bansal", 
                    "Preeti Saraswat", 
                    "Manish Nandle"]
list_of_prob = [0.05, 0.15, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.3]
d = {}
for i in range(10):
    a = {}
    lst = choices(lnct_few_friends, weights=list_of_prob, k=10)
    for name in set(lnct_few_friends):
        a[name] = lst.count(name)
    d[i] = a
    

# Lets print the results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from  matplotlib import ticker
import math
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
for key, val in d.items():
    plt.plot(val.keys() ,val.values(), marker="x")
```

In the above graph, you can see that everytime, "X" were the lowest and "Mukesh" & "Manish" were the highests names in the created list and more I increase the value of `k` more prominent the graph becomes as shown in the below code and graph


```python
from random import choices
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

k = 900

lnct_few_friends = ["X", "Jyoti Pancholi", "Amit Shrivastava", "Mukesh Bansal", "Preeti Saraswat", "Manish Nandle"]
list_of_prob = [0.05, 0.15, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.3]
d = {}
for i in range(10):
    a = {}
    lst = choices(lnct_few_friends, weights=list_of_prob, k=k)
    for name in set(lnct_few_friends):
        a[name] = lst.count(name)
    d[i] = a

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from  matplotlib import ticker
import math
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
for key, val in d.items():
    plt.plot(val.keys() ,val.values(), marker="o")
```
