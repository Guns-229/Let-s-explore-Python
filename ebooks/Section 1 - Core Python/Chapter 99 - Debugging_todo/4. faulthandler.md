`faulthandler` can be used to dump Python tracebacks explicitly on 
- a fault, 
- a timeout, 
- a user signal. 

`faulthandler.enable()` installs fault handlers for the `SIGSEGV`, `SIGFPE`, `SIGABRT`, `SIGBUS`, and `SIGILL`signals.
It can also be enabled by setting the `PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1` environment variable or by using the `-X faulthandler` command line option.

### Dump

`dump_tractback` funtion can be used to dump the `trackback` to a file as shown in the below exmaple. Its syntax is as follows

```python
faulthandler.dump_traceback(file=sys.stderr, all_threads=True)
```


```python
import faulthandler 

faulthandler.enable()

try:
    a = 1/0
except Exception as e:
    with open("Error.log", "a+") as f:
        faulthandler.dump_traceback(file=f, all_threads=True)
```

### `enable()`

`enable` not only starts the `faulthandler` but can also be used to define the log files as shown in the below example. After executing the below example, SEGFAULT details are 

```python
# Reference: https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/22352/38159
# Code by `Gareth Rees` https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/2186/gareth-rees

import faulthandler as fh

f = open("Error_auto.log", "a+")
fh.enable(file=f, all_threads=True)

exec(type((lambda:0).__code__)(0,1,0,0,0,b'',(),(),(),'','',1,b''))
```

### `disable()`

It disables the fault handler, thus uninstalls any signal handlers installed by `enable()`.

If it is able to disable fault handler then it returns `True` else returns `False` which can happen if fault handler is already disabled.

### `is_enabled()`

It returns `True` if fault handler is enabled else returns `False`


```python
import faulthandler as fh

print(fh.is_enabled())
print(fh.disable())

fh.enable(all_threads=True)
print(fh.is_enabled())
print(fh.disable())
```

    True
    True
    True
    True


### Examples:

As stated above, we can initiate traceback dump in three scenarios. We are going to cover all of them. 

#### Fatal Errors

`faulthandler.enable()` & `dump_traceback` can be used in these cases as shown in the below examples.


```python
import faulthandler 


faulthandler.enable()
try:
    a = 1/0
except Exception as e:
    with open("Error.log", "a+") as f:
        faulthandler.dump_traceback(file=f, all_threads=True)
```

### Timeout

`faulthandler.dump_tracebacks_later()` can be used to set the timeout. It will trigger the traceback if any function exceeds to timeout time set in `dump_tracebacks_later` as shown in the below examples.

- Example 1: Default timeout to 5 sec.

```python
import faulthandler


def MySample():
    import time
    time.sleep(10)
    return "Welcome to the Wonders of Python"

faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(5)
MySample()
```

**Output:**
```python
Timeout (0:00:05)!
Thread 0x00007f9b082e7540 (most recent call first):
  File "timeout_example.py", line 10 in MySample
  File "timeout_example.py", line 13 in <module>
```

- Example 2: Default `timeout` to `2 sec` and `repeat = True`.

Use the `repeat=True` option to dump the traceback for each timeout,

```PYTHON
import faulthandler


def MySample():
    import time
    time.sleep(3)
    return "Welcome to the Wonders of Python"


log_file = "dump_later.txt"
f = open(log_file, "w")
faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(2, file=f, repeat=True)
txt = MySample()
print(txt)
f.close()
faulthandler.cancel_dump_traceback_later()

with open(log_file) as fp:
    for line in fp.readlines():
        print(line, end="")
```

**Output:**
```python
Welcome to the Wonders of Python
Timeout (0:00:02)!
Thread 0x00007f9cea59f540 (most recent call first):
  File "timeout_repeat_example.py", line 6 in MySample
  File "timeout_repeat_example.py", line 13 in <module>
```

- Example 3: Default `timeout` to `2 sec`, `repeat = True` and function taking 6 sec to complete.

    In this scenario, the traceback will happen 3 times (6 / 2 = 3) as 

    `log_times = time_taken/timeout`

```python
import faulthandler


def MySample():
    import time
    time.sleep(6)
    return "Welcome to the Wonders of Python"


log_file = "dump_later.txt"
f = open(log_file, "w")
faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(2, file=f, repeat=True)
txt = MySample()
print(txt)
f.close()
faulthandler.cancel_dump_traceback_later()

with open(log_file) as fp:
    for line in fp.readlines():
        print(line, end="")
```
**Output:**
```python

```

- Example 4: Default `timeout` to `2 sec`, `repeat = True` and `exit=True`.
    
    In this scenario where `exit=True` is set, program will exit out at the first timeout as shown in the example below. Also note that it will exit the program in unsafe mode, that is no cleanup will be performed, if any files are open, they **might** be left open after the program has exited. 
    
    Also note, that it override's `repeat=True` and exit outs on the first occurrence of timeout.

```python
import faulthandler


def MySample():
    import time
    time.sleep(6)
    return "Welcome to the Wonders of Python"


faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(2, repeat=True, exit=True)
txt = MySample()
print(txt)
faulthandler.cancel_dump_traceback_later()

```
**Output:**
```python
Timeout (0:00:02)!

```
    

### User Signal

`faulthandler.register(signal)`

1. It is not available for Windows.

```python
from threading import Thread
import faulthandler
import signal
import time


def do():
    time.sleep(10)


def main():
    threads = []
    for _ in range(1, 10):
        t = Thread(target=do, args=())
        t.start()
    for x in threads:
        x.join()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    faulthandler.register(signal.SIGUSR1)
    main()
```
**Output:**
```python
$:> python3 register_example.py &
[1] 29577

$:> kill -s USR1 29577

### Issue with file descriptors


`enable()`, `dump_traceback_later()` and `register()` keep the file descriptor of their file argument. If the file is closed and its file descriptor is reused by a new file, or if `os.dup2()` is used to replace the file descriptor, the traceback will be written into a different file. Call these functions again each time that the file is replaced.
