### Time

Python has two modules to handle time:

- `Time`: implements functions that allow using the time generated by the system.
- `Datetime`: implements high-level types to perform date and time operations.

Example with time:

#### `Time`


```python
import time

# localtime() Returns a date and local time in the form 
# of a structure called struct_time, which is a 
# collection with the items: year, month, day, hour, minute,
# secund, day of the week, day of the year and e daylight saving time
print (time.localtime())
```

    time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=8, tm_mday=25, tm_hour=19, tm_min=0, tm_sec=17, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=237, tm_isdst=0)



```python
lt = time.localtime()
print(lt.tm_year, lt.tm_mon)
```

    2019 8



```python
# asctime() returns a date and hour with string, according to
# operating system configuration
print (time.asctime())
```

    Sun Aug 25 19:00:17 2019



```python
# time() returns system time in seconds
ts1 = time.time()
print(ts1)
```

    1566739817.581436



```python
# quick way to find how much time your program take for its execution
ts1 = time.time()
# busy doing some work 
time.sleep(4)
ts2 = time.time()
print(ts2 - ts1)
```

    4.001931190490723



```python
# gmtime() converts seconds to struct_time
tt1 = time.gmtime(ts1)
print (ts1, '->', tt1)
```

    1566739817.5942478 -> time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=8, tm_mday=25, tm_hour=13, tm_min=30, tm_sec=17, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=237, tm_isdst=0)



```python
tt1 = time.gmtime(0)
print (ts1, '->', tt1)
```

    1566739817.5942478 -> time.struct_time(tm_year=1970, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=0, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=1, tm_isdst=0)



```python
# Finding Future date time details

days = 10
tt2 = time.gmtime(ts1 + 60*60*24*days)
print(tt2)
```

    time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=9, tm_mday=4, tm_hour=13, tm_min=30, tm_sec=17, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=247, tm_isdst=0)



```python
# mktime() converts struct_time  to seconds
ts2 = time.mktime(tt2)
print (ts2, '->', tt2)
```

    1567584017.0 -> time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=9, tm_mday=4, tm_hour=13, tm_min=30, tm_sec=17, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=247, tm_isdst=0)



```python
# clock() returs time since the program started, in seconds
print ('The program took', time.clock(), \
    'seconds up to now...')
```

    The program took 0.90569 seconds up to now...


    /Users/mayank.johri/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:2: DeprecationWarning: time.clock has been deprecated in Python 3.3 and will be removed from Python 3.8: use time.perf_counter or time.process_time instead
      



```python
# Counting seconds...
for i in range(5):
    # sleep() waits the number of seconds specified as parameter
    time.sleep(1)
    print (i + 1, 'second(s)')
```

    1 second(s)
    2 second(s)
    3 second(s)
    4 second(s)
    5 second(s)



```python
# Same code as above, but created a utility function for count_down 
import time

def count_down(x):
    # Counting seconds...
    for i in range(x):
        # sleep() waits the number of seconds specified as parameter
        time.sleep(1)
        print (i + 1, 'second(s) passed')

count_down(4)
print("countdown completed")
```

    1 second(s) passed
    2 second(s) passed
    3 second(s) passed
    4 second(s) passed
    countdown completed


#### datetime

In *datetime*, four types are defined for representing time:

+ *datetime*: date and time.
+ *date*: just date.
+ *time*: just time.
+ *timedelta*: time diference.

Example:


```python
import time
import datetime

# datetime() receives as parameter:
# year, month, day, hour, minute, second and 
# returns an object of type datetime
dt = datetime.datetime(2041, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59)

# Objects date and time can be created from
# a datetime object
date = dt.date()
hour = dt.time()
print ('Date:', date)
print ('Hour:', hour)
# How many time to 12/31/2020

for _ in range(4):
    dd = dt - dt.today()
    print('How many time to 12/31/2041:', dd)
    time.sleep(2)
```

    Date: 2041-12-31
    Hour: 23:59:59
    How many time to 12/31/2041: 8164 days, 4:59:28.233652
    How many time to 12/31/2041: 8164 days, 4:59:26.230481
    How many time to 12/31/2041: 8164 days, 4:59:24.225755
    How many time to 12/31/2041: 8164 days, 4:59:22.221324



```python

```
