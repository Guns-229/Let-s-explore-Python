---

This book has been created as part of reference material for learning Python languages. The entire training material has been divided into three sections

* Core Python
* Advance Python &
* Machine Learning

This e-book will try to cover only **"core python"** and I am in a process of finishing the other two e-books. I am planning to release the First (draft) versions of them with following time lines. 

- "Lets Explore Advance Python" might be released sometime in Jan 2020
- "Lets Explore Machine Learning using Python" by Feb 2020
- "Lets Explore Machine Learning using R" by April 2020.
- "Frequently Asked Interview Questions in ML (Python)" by Feb 2020
- "Frequently Asked Interview Questions in ML (R)" by March 2020

This section is specifically designed for everyone who wish to work/learn Python language.
