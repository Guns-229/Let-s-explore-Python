With diffs you can only see that much, thus how about start looking in other places? Think about all the other components that might depend on this change. Where any of the APIs violated?\n",

    "Is it within the scope? Does the ticket touch any unrelated parts of the codebase or does side fixes? The more it gets cluttered, the more complicated it becomes to review, test and release. Stay on topic.\n",

    "Are there any code style issues? Conventions are important for the sake of codebase sanity. I know we all have strong opinions about all the things, but for your team and code well-being, please disagree and commit.\n",

If something fails, it should be apparent what broke.\n",

Try to think of ways it might fail: feed it large sets of data, consider third-party systems downtime and how it can affect you, use an unusual email address (did you know email address can have comments in-between tokens?).

    "Code Is Easy To Debug\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Code Documentation\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Indentation And Readability\n",
    "\n",
    "All developers in a team needs to use common formatting tool with same formatting styles to avoid version control conflicts and difficulty in reading file changes. There is no right or wrong way to format code, however make sure the team uses the same formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling code is often ignored in critical timelines. A code reviewer must ensure that sufficient exception handling is done in code. Unit test cases should also be addd to check for all exception scenarios. Some common exception scenarios are\n",

    "Logging Key Attributes For Debugging\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Eliminate Unwanted Code And Libraries If Not Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Its common habit of developers to not remove unused code from a file. This is mainly since they think it may be required in future. Some developers tend to comment it so it can be used later. This makes the code unreadable. The code reviewer must make sure that all such code is removed. Developers can always go back to a previous version of code in version control. However, in my observation, a commented code is almost always not reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling NULL And Empty Object Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "Not handling NULL and Empty objects causes many production related problems. A code reviewer must be explicitly watching for these issues.  Unit test cases should also be addd to check for all NULL and Empty object scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sticking To Coding Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "A software needs to follow consistent coding practices. There are coding standards available in almost any programming language. Stick to the standard coding practices to ensure everyone speaks the same language. It makes it easier for a new developer to start understanding the code faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Hard Coding - Prefer Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Many configurations are often hard coded by developers inside the compiled code and makes it difficult to change the behavior of software. For example an optional feature should have a configuration that can enable or disable a feature. I code reviewer my look for such opportunities to ensure configuration is preferred over hard coding.\n",

    "\n",
    "Code Performance\n",

    "Will the current software scale with new changes.\n",
    "Will there be any impact on scalability in future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Security Review\n",
    "\n",
    "This is most difficult step in code review since not many people know how to write secure code. Some common guidelines are listed below for a secure code\n",
    "Encrypt sensitive user information (e.g. SSN, passwords, credit card numbers etc)\n",
    "Never log sensitive information on log files, it can be dangerous and make hacking easy.\n",
    "Disable Weak Ciphers on your app/web servers.\n",
    "Use trusted libraries for cryptography and encryption instead of inventing your own.\n",
    "Watch for OWASP top 10 issues are addressed in a web facing application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Releasing Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Releasing resources in a busy application is really important step that is often missed out by hasty developers. Ensure all important and shared resources are being released by each code block. Following scenario must be covered\n",
    "\n",
    "Releasing of resources after the task is completed successfully.\n",
    "Releasing resources after the task has failed.\n",
    "Release resources after there is exception in processing task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encourage Code Reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy/Paste is developers best friend.  Many lines of code is duplicated by simply doing a copy paste. This seems to solve problem in short term however creates maintenance issues in long run. Any copy/paste candidate in code must be refactored to be re-usable. It needs to be done carefully since many other code blocks may be calling it already.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency, Thread Safety And Deadlock Related Issues Are Considered\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the developers are not writing multi threading code and concurrent applications. Therefore these aspects are often ignored by developers. You must pay careful attention to your code block and understand its behavior when multiple thread will try to access it at same time. Ensure all shared variables are minimized and handling concurrency of multiple threads is not leading to a potential deadlock situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Of Design Patterns When Required\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not easy to spot a design pattern in a bad code, however an experience programmer can easily suggest a better approach provided enough knowledge of the software. \n",
    "Try to spot common design pattern application on existing code and see how you can improve it. Use of design pattern improves maintainability of source code."
