If you look at the three ways to exploit inheritance, two of the three involve writing new code to replace or alter functionality. This can easily be replicated by just calling functions in a module. Here's an example of doing this:"

    "## When to Use Inheritance or Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of \"inheritance versus composition\" comes down to an attempt to solve the problem of reusable code. You don't want to have duplicated code all over your software, since that's not clean and efficient. Inheritance solves this problem by creating a mechanism for you to have implied features in base classes. Composition solves this by giving you modules and the ability to call functions in other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If both solutions solve the problem of reuse, then which one is appropriate in which situations? The answer is incredibly subjective, but I'll give you my three guidelines for when to do which:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid multiple inheritance at all costs, as it's too complex to be reliable. If you're stuck with it, then be prepared to know the class hierarchy and spend time finding where everything is coming from.\n",
    "* Use composition to package code into modules that are used in many different unrelated places and situations.\n",
    "* Use inheritance only when there are clearly related reusable pieces of code that fit under a single common concept or if you have to because of something you're using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not be a slave to these rules. The thing to remember about object-oriented programming is that it is entirely a social convention programmers have created to package and share code. Because it's a social convention, but one that's codified in Python, you may be forced to avoid these rules because of the people you work with. In that case, find out how they use things and then just adapt to the situation."
