# Chapter 3: Compound statements
_____________________________

Compound statements contain one or groups of other statements; they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way. 

In general, they span multiple lines, but can be also be listed in a single line.

The `if`, `while` and `for` statements implement **traditional control flow constructs**, whereas `try` specifies **exception handlers and/or cleanup code** for a group of statements, while the `with` statement allows the execution of initialization and finalization code around a block of code. `Function` and `class` definitions are also **syntactically compound statements**.

They consists of one or more *‘clauses’*. A *clause* consists of a 'header' and a ‘suite’. 

The 'clause' headers of a particular compound statement are all at the same indentation level. They should begins with an uniquely identifying keyword and should ends with a colon. 

'suite' is a group of statements controlled by a clause. It can be of one or more semicolon-separated simple statements on the same line as the header, following the header’s colon (one liner), or it can be one or more indented statements on subsequent lines. Only the latter form of a suite can contain nested compound statements; the following is illegal, mostly because it wouldn’t be clear to which if clause a following else clause would belong:

## Traditional Control Flow Constructs
---
### `if` Statement

The `if` statement is used for conditional execution similar to that in most common languages. If statement can be constructed in three format depending on our need.

- **if**:  when we have "**if** something do something" condition
- **if .. else**: when we have condition like "**if** something: do something **else** do something else" 
- **if .. elif ..else**: When we have too many conditions or nested conditions

#### `if`
This format is used when specific operation needs to be performed if a specific condition is met. 
Syntax:
```python
if <condition>:
    <code block>
```


Where:

+ `<condition>`: sentence that can be evaluated as true or false.
+ `<code block>`: sequence of command lines.
+ The clauses `elif` and `else` are optional and  several `elifs` for the `if` may be used but only  one `else` at the end.
+ Parentheses are only required to avoid ambiguity.
Example:


```python
x = "Mayank"
y = "TEST"

if y == "TEST":
    print(x)
```

    Mayank



```python
if y:
    print("Hello World,", y)
```

    Hello World, TEST



```python
y = None

if y:
    print("TEST")
```


```python
y = 0
if y:
    print("TEST")
```


```python
y = []
if y:
    print("TEST")
```


```python
# For C & Java Guys
if input("Please enter the password:") == "Simsim": #{
    print("\t> Welcome to the cave")
#}

print("Bye bye")
```

#### Cascading of if


```python
x = 12
if x > 10:
    print("Hello")
    if x > 10.999999999999:
        print("Hello again")
        if x % 2 == 0:
            print("Bye bye bye ...")
```

    Hello
    Hello again
    Bye bye bye ...



```python
x = 11
if x > 10:
    print("Hello")
    if x > 10.999999999999:
        print("Hello again")
        if x % 2 == 0:
            print("Bye bye bye ...")
```

    Hello
    Hello again



```python
x = "Green"
y = None
z = "111"
print(id(y))
if x == "Green":
    print("Hello x is Green")

if x == 'Yellow':
    print("Hello in Y")

if x == 'Orange':
    print("Hello in Z")
```

    4556083288
    Hello x is Green


### `if` ... `else` statement

```python
if <condition>:
    <code block>
else:
    <code block>
```
Where:

+ `<condition>`: sentence that can be evaluated as true `if` statement `if` statemente or false.
+ `<code block>`: sequence of command lines.
+ The clauses `elif` and `else` are optional and  several `elifs` for the `if` may be used but only  one `else` at the end.
+ Parentheses are only required to avoid ambiguity.


```python
x = "Anuja"

if x == "mayank":  #{
    print("Name is mayank")
#}
else:  #{
    print("Name is not mayank and its", x)
#}
```

    Name is not mayank and its Anuja



```python
x = "Anuja"

if x != "mayank":
    print("Name is not mayank and its", x)
else:
    print("Name is mayank")
```

    Name is not mayank and its Anuja



```python
x = "Orange"

if x == "Green":
    print("Hello x is Green")
else:
    if x == 'Yellow':
        print("Hello in Y")
    else:
        if x == 'Orange':
            print("Hello in Z")
```

    Hello in Z


### `if` ...`elif` ... `else` statement

```python
if <condition>:
    <code block>
elif <condition>:
    <code block>
elif <condition>:
    <code block>
else:
    <code block>
```

Where:

+ `<condition>`: sentence that can be evaluated as true or false.
+ `<code block>`: sequence of command lines.
+ The clauses `elif` and `else` are optional and  several `elifs` for the `if` may be used but only  one `else` at the end.
+ Parentheses are only required to avoid ambiguity.


```python
# In this case we will exit after executing 
# first true condition block
cols = "Orange", "Red", "Green"
orange, red, green = "Orange", "Red", "Green"
if orange in cols:
    print("Hello is", orange)
elif red in cols:
    print("Hello is", red)
elif green in cols:
    print("Hello is", green)
```

    Hello is Orange



```python
# temperature value used to test
# Logical Issue ? Find it if you can.
temp = 20

if temp < 0:
    print('Freezing...')
elif 0 <= temp <= 20:
    print ('Cold')
elif 21 <= temp <= 25:
    print('Room Temprature')
elif 26 <= temp <= 35:
    print ('Hot')
else:
    print('Its very HOT!, lets stay at home... \nand drink lemonade.')
```

    Cold



```python
# temperature value used to test
temp = 20.3

if temp < 0:
    print('Freezing...')
elif 0 <= temp <= 20:
    print ('Cold')
elif 21 <= temp <= 25:
    print('Room Temprature')
elif 26 <= temp <= 35:
    print ('Hot')
else:
    print('Its very HOT!, lets stay at home... \nand drink lemonade.')
```

    Its very HOT!, lets stay at home... 
    and drink lemonade.



```python
# temperature value used to test
# logical issue solved. 

temp = 20.2

if temp <= 0:
    print('Freezing...')
elif 0 < temp <= 20:
    print ('Cold')
elif 20 < temp <= 25:
    print('Room Temprature')
elif 25 < temp <= 35:
    print ('Hot')
else:
    print('Its very HOT!, lets stay at home... \nand drink lemonade.')
```

    Room Temprature


Imagine that in the above program, `23` is the temperature which was read by  some sensor or manually entered by the user and `Normal` is the response of the program.

**NOTE**: This construct will only run the first true if block and will skip all the others as shown in the below example


```python
a = "apple"
b = "banana"
c = "Mango"

if a == "apple":
    print("apple")
elif b == "banana":
    print("mango")
elif c == "Mango":
    print("My Mango farm")
```

    apple



```python
x = "Orange"

if x == "Green":
    print("Hello x is Green")
elif x == 'Yellow':
    print("Hello in Y")
elif x == 'Orange':
    print("Hello in Z")
```

    Hello in Z



```python
user_selection = "Orange"
orange, red, green = "Orange", "Red", "Green"
if user_selection == orange:
    print("Hello user_selection is", orange)
elif user_selection == red:
    print("Hello user_selection is", red)
elif user_selection == green:
    print("Hello user_selection is", green)
```

    Hello user_selection is Orange


## One line if 

There are instances where we might need to have 
If the code block is composed of only one line, it can be written after the colon:

    if temp < 0: print 'Freezing...'


```python
x = 20

if x > 10: print ("Hello ")
```

    Hello 



```python
# Intresting example
x = 20

if x > 10: print ("Hello "); print("How are you doing")
```

    Hello 
    How are you doing


Since version 2.5, Python supports the expression:
```python
<variable> = <value 1> if <condition> else <value 2>
```
Where `<variable>` receives `<value 1>` if `<condition>` is true and `<value 2>`  otherwise.


```python
val = 1 if x < 10 else 24
print(val)
```

    24


### `if` expression extended

we can extend one liner `if` using `()`'s as shown in the below example. 


```python
temp = 30

(print ('Freezing...') if temp < 0 else
print ('Cold') if 0 < temp <= 20 else
print ('Room Temprature') if 20 < temp <= 25 else 
print("Hot") if 25 < temp <= 35 else
print ('Its very HOT!, lets stay at home... \nand drink lemonade.'))
```

    Hot



```python
# Optimized code
temp = 30

print(('Freezing...' if temp < 0 else
'Cold' if 0 < temp <= 20 else
'Room Temprature' if 20 < temp <= 25 else 
"Hot" if 25 < temp <= 35 else
'Its very HOT!, lets stay at home... \nand drink lemonade.'))
```

    Hot


We have converted one previous multi `if-elif-else` example to `single line if-else` construct.

### Suite

Python allows to have more than one statements on a single line using `;` and its called `suite` (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html). Very simple suite is as shown in the exmples below


```python
print("He", end=""); print("l", end=""); print("lo")
```

    Hello



```python
x = 10; print(x); x +=20; print(x)
```

    10
    30


as you can see in the above example we can have more than one statements in a simple line. Lets check its effect on other compound constructs

### `Suite` and `if`

the entire suite will get executed only when the `if` condition is fulfilled.


```python
x = 10
if x <= 10: print("He", end=""); print("l", end=""); print("lo")
print("...")
```

    Hello
    ...


else the entire suite will not get executed.


```python
x = 30
if x <= 10: print("He", end=""); print("l", end=""); print("lo")
print("...")
```

    ...


> **NOTE:**<hr>
> The semicolon binds tighter than the colon in the above context, thus either all or none of the `print()` calls are executed

#### Gotcha's

1. We can only have first statement as compound statements and all the following cannot be compound statementas (statements with `:`) as shown in the examples below.

```python
x = 20; if x <= 10: print("l", end=""); print("lo")
```
**Output:**
```python
  File "<ipython-input-14-cf119c4c1398>", line 2
    x = 20; if x <= 10: print("l", end=""); print("lo")
             ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
``` 

As one liner `if` do not have `:` in its construct it can be present in following statements as shown in the below example


```python
size = 10
color = "blue"

if size > 8: print("> 8 and blue in color") if color == "blue" else print("> 8 but not blue color");print("Swagatam")
```

    > 8 and blue in color
    Swagatam


The below example will not work as last statement was ":" in it, 
```python
# this one will not work
x = 20
if x > 10: print("Greater than 10") if x > 15 else print("less than") else: print("TEST")
```
**Output:**
```python
  File "<ipython-input-34-ad260d588f22>", line 2
    if x > 10: print("Greater than 10") if x > 15 else print("less than") else: print("TEST")
                                                                             ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

But, following will work without issue. 


```python
size = 10
color = "blue"
if size > 8: x = 10 and True or False; print(x) 
```

    True



```python
if size > 8: print("> 8 and blue in color"); print(10) if color == "blue" else print("> 8 but not blue color"); print("Hello ")
```

    > 8 and blue in color
    10
    Hello 


### Uses of suite

#### running at command prompt/interpretor

```python
$:> python -c "import os; print(os.path.join('test', 'test'))"
```

#### initiating pdb

easy to write and easy to remove. 


```python
# import pdb; pdb.sta...
```

#### Ending multiline statement


```python
temp = 30

print(('Freezing...' if temp < 0 else
'Cold' if 0 < temp <= 20 else
'Room Temprature' if 20 < temp <= 25 else 
"Hot" if 25 < temp <= 35 else
'Its very HOT!, lets stay at home... \nand drink lemonade.'));
```

    Hot


#### for c/c++ guys (joke)


```python
# now your code looks like c/c++ :)
temp = 20;
print(temp);
```

    20
