    "Till 2005, Freebasic, VB, VB.NET & C were my primary programming languages. In early 2005, due to certain personal & political (read M$) reasons, I started searching for my next primary language. My requirement for it were few as listed below:\n",
    "- Opensource language (so I don't have to pay, no licensing issues, no change in language without some workaround for changes)\n",
    "- Easy to learn (Never had too much time)\n",

I liked \"FreeBasic\" and also migrated one crutial utility of `SoftGridHelper` to it from Python/.Net, since, that utility was to always running on user machines and was to be installed on nearly every machine on the client infrastructure (excluding servers) and \"FreeBasic\" provided me an exeuctable with in few \"kb's\" and without horrible dependency issues of `.NET` versions and it was used in few corporates without any issue."
