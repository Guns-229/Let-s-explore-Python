## Boolean

### True, False and None

In Python, the boolean type (*bool*) is special integer type (*int*) which can only have one of the two values, i.e. *True* (value equal to 1) or *False* (value equal to 0).

- `False`
    + `False`.

    The following values can also considered **like** **false**:

    + `None` (null).
    + `0` (zero).
    + `''` (empty string).
    + `[]` (empty list).
    + `()` (empty tuple).
    + `{}` (emtpy dicionary).
    + Other structures with size equal zero.

All other objects out of that list are considered **like** **true**.

The object `None`, which is of type `NoneType`, in Python represents the `None` and is evaluated as false by the interpreter.


```python
a = True
b = False
```


```python
print(a == True)
```

    True



```python
print(b == False)
```

    True



```python
print(b is False)
```

    True



```python
c = 0
d = []
e = None
```


```python
print(c == False)
print(d == False)  # They behave like False but are not False, In controls chapter we will discuss it in details
print(e == False)  # They behave like False but are not False, In controls chapter we will discuss it in details
```

    True
    False
    False


Please note, that `0` or other values which acts like `False` are not `False` but only behaves like `False` as shown in the below example


```python
print(c is False)
```

    False



```python
print(c is 0)
```

    True



```python
x = 0

print(x == False)
print(x is False)
```

    True
    False



```python
x = 1

print(x == True)
print(x is True)
```

    True
    False



```python
x = 10
print(x == True)  # They behave like True but are not True, In controls chapter we will discuss it in details
```

    False
