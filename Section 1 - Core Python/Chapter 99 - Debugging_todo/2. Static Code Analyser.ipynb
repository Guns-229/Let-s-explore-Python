    "Most of the time, `Cyclomatic complexity` which was defined by **Thomas J. McCabe, Sr**. in 1976 and is computed using the control-flow graph of the program: the nodes of the graph correspond to indivisible groups of commands of a program, and a directed edge connects two nodes if the second command might be executed immediately after the first command. Cyclomatic complexity may also be applied to individual functions, modules, methods or classes within a program.\n",

    "- `-nc` tells radon to print only results with a complexity rank of C or worse. Other examples: -na (from A to F), or -nd (from D to F).\n",
