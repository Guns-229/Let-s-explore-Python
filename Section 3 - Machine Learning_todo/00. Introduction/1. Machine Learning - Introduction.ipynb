    "    * _**Regression**_: It is a measure of the relation between the mean value of one variable (e.g. output) and  corresponding values of other variables (e.g. time and cost). It is defined as E[Y | X] (the expectation of `Y` for given `X`). A subset of these types of models where `Y` is binary or categorical (including logistic regression and multinomial regression along with many machine learning algorithms that essential have the same target [such as `classification trees`]) are useful for `classification`.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning** in which the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization (Click here to go to the `Scikit`-Learn unsupervised learning page).\n",
    "- **Semi-supervised learning** in which combines both labeled and unlabeled example to generate an appropriate function or classifier.\n",
